# Perceptron-Learning-Algorithm
In this I have tried to implement Perceptron Learning Algorithm in 2d so that we can visualize the algorithm in subsequent iterations.
Further more I recommend reading a supplementary pdf file attached for mathematical details.Just running the jupyter notebook is enough as there are no inputs required.
You will also find a sample of results in the pdf.
